1. Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
* The app (which I decided to name M2A Planner) is designed to be a user-friendly event tracking app that lets users keep track of personalized event lists. After logging in, you're able to add, update, and delete events - with details including the name, time, and date. Keeping the interface simple and concise was one key rule I tried to follow so that it's clear for users how each task can be accomplished.
2. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
* To meet the all of the user requirements, a login screen, SMS permission screen, event list screen, and add event screen needed to be added. Additionally, a feature to send a text message when a new event is scheduled had to implemented. The design allows the user to very quickly traverse the app and accomplish these tasks while receiving feedback from their input, which is why I personally think they worked well from a design standpoint!
3. How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
* I worked on the code for my app slowly, finishing each portion before moving on to the next. Working incrementally in this way is something that I've learned has helped to make bigger projects feel less overwhelming, and spending enough time on each module means they can be fully tested and checked for quality without having to rush. I used this for strategy for both comment documentation and code, and absolutely plan to cntinue using it in the future.
