1. Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
* The app (which I decided to name M2A Planner) is designed to be a user-friendly event tracking app that lets users keep track of personalized event lists. After logging in, you're able to add, update, and delete events- with details including the name, time, and date. Keeping the interface simple and concise was one key aspect so that it's clear for users how to do everything they need to do.
2. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
* To meet the user requirements, a login screen, SMS permission screen, event list screen, and add event screen needed to be added; as well as a feature to send a text message when a new event is scheduled. All of these were designed to be able to allow the user to very quickly traverse the app and accomplish these tasks, which is why I think they worked well from a design standpoint.
